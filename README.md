Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the quality of wines using the wine.data dataset. The dataset contains various chemical properties of wines along with their quality ratings. The goal is to develop predictive models that can accurately classify or predict the quality of wines based on their chemical attributes.

Dataset

The wine.data dataset includes the following features:
Fixed acidity
Volatile acidity
Citric acid
Residual sugar
Chlorides
Free sulfur dioxide
Total sulfur dioxide
Density
pH
Sulphates
Alcohol
Quality (score between 0 and 10)

Models Used
Ridge Regression
Ridge regression is used to address multicollinearity and mitigate the impact of outliers by adding a penalty equivalent to square of the magnitude of coefficients. This helps in reducing model complexity and improving generalization.

Lasso Regression
Lasso regression, on the other hand, uses a penalty equivalent to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients, which can lead to feature selection by effectively setting some coefficients to zero. This can result in a more interpretable model.

Acknowledgments
The wine.data dataset was sourced from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Inspiration and initial code structure were adapted from various open-source projects and tutorials.
